**List of Experiments:**
 1. WAP to implement the Perceptron Learning Algorithm using numpy in Python. Evaluate performance of a single perceptron for NAND and XOR truth tables as input dataset. 
 2. WAP to implement a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network with one hidden layer using numpy in Python. Demonstrate that it can learn the XOR Boolean function.  
 3. WAP to implement a three-layer neural network using Tensor flow library (only, no keras) to classify MNIST handwritten digits dataset. Demonstrate the implementation of feed-forward and back-propagation approaches. 
 4. WAP to evaluate the performance of implemented three-layer neural network with variations in activation functions, size of hidden layer, learning rate, batch size and number of epochs. 
 5. WAP to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network using Keras Library to classify MNIST fashion dataset. Demonstrate the effect of filter size, regularization, batch size and optimization algorithm on model performance. 
 6. WAP to train and evaluate a Recurrent Neural Network using PyTorch Library to predict the next value in a sample time series dataset. 
 7. WAP to retrain a pretrained imagenet model to classify a medical image dataset.


**Datasets:**

1. from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
2. from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist(https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
